# Client

The web client uses the following technologies: 

* ReactJS
* Typescript
* Redux
* Saga
* Styled components 


## Choices made

I made the choice to not use any standard component library (material ui, bootstrap, etc.) and instead work on building my own component library in order to upskill my CSS and animation skills, and contribute alternatives to the open source community.
